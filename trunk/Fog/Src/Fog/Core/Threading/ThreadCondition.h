// ============================================================================
// [Fog::ThreadCondition]
// ============================================================================

//! @brief Condition variable.
//!
//! ThreadCondition wraps pthreads condition variable synchronization or, on
//! Windows, simulates it. This functionality is very helpful for having several
//! threads wait for an event, as is common with a thread pool managed by a
//! master. The meaning of such an event in the (worker) thread pool scenario
//! is that additional tasks are now available for processing.
//!
//! USAGE NOTE 1: spurious signal events are possible with this and most
//! implementations of condition variables. As a result, be sure to retest
//! your condition before proceeding. The following is a good example of doing
//! this correctly:
//!
//! while (!work_to_be_done())
//!   wait(...);
//!
//! In contrast do NOT do the following:
//!
//! if (!work_to_be_done())
//!   wait(...);
//!
//! Especially avoid the above if you are relying on some other thread only
//! issuing a signal up *if* there is work-to-do.  There can/will be spurious
//! signals. Recheck state on waiting thread before assuming the signal was
//! intentional. Caveat caller.
//!
//! The broadcast() method frees up all waiting threads at once, which leads
//! to contention for the locks they all held when they called wait(). This
//! results in poor performance. A much better approach to getting a lot of
//! threads out of wait() is to have each thread (upon exiting wait()) call
//! signal() to free up another waiting thread.
//!
//! Broadcast() can be used nicely during teardown, as it gets the job done,
//! and leaves no sleeping threads... and performance is less critical at that
//! point.
//!
//! The semantics of broadcast() are carefully crafted so that all threads that
//! were waiting when the request was made will indeed get signaled. Some
//! implementations mess up, and don't signal them all, while others allow the
//! wait to be effectively turned off (for a while while waiting threads come
//! around). This implementation appears correct, as it will not lose any
//! signals, and will guarantee that all threads get signaled by broadcast().
//!
//! This implementation offers support for "performance" in its selection of
//! which thread to revive. Performance, in direct contrast with "fairness,"
//! assures that the thread that most recently began to wait() is selected by
//! signal to revive. Fairness would (if publicly supported) assure that the
//! thread that has wait()ed the longest is selected. The default policy may
//! improve performance, as the selected thread may have a greater chance of
//! having some of its stack data in various CPU caches.
