2010-05-19
- Moved object hierarchy management into Fog::Object.
- Cleaned up Widget + Layout code.

2010-05-15
- Added ARGB<->AHSV color conversion.
- Added Painter::drawImage() that can stretch image.

2010-05-12
- Removed Fog::BitArray, currently not used and unfinished.
- Removed Fog::ScopedHANDLE, never used too.
- Renamed INTERPOLATION_TYPE to IMAGE_INTERPOLATION_TYPE and COLOR_INTERPOLATION_TYPE.
- Fixed Stroker, now degenerate cases are stroked correctly.
- Fixed Path::addRound().
- Fixed Path::arcTo().
- Fixed DoublePath::getBoundingRect(), now the bounding rect is correct.
- Added DoublePath::fitTo(), uses getBoundingRect() internally.
- Fixed compiling under 32-bit Linux / MinGW (GCC issue), added some inline assembly.
- Rewritten blitters and spans. Now it's able to use single span structure for nearly 
  all blit operations, see SPAN_TYPE, Span, Span8, SpanExt8.
- Optimized pattern fetchers, they can now fetch more patterns in single function call
  (blitting is also single function call so now the function call overhead is minimized).
- Added basic support for text rotation, incomplete, not works when using FreeType.
- C/MMX/SSE2 code was split into many files, now it's more readable.
- RasterPaintEngine code was split too, isolating core engine, commands, calculations,
  renderers and workers (used for multithreading)
- Renamed other files in Fog/Graphics package (ImageIO/Bmp.cpp to ImageIO/ImageIO_Bmp.cpp,
  etc. This scheme was used in past, abandoned and refreshed).
- FogBench tool split into several files, many imporvements to test also SRC operator.
- FogBench tool contains Qt4 benchmark, implicitly disabled.
- Improved SVG support (fill and stroke opacity, added support for polygon and polyline).
- Improved XML support (added missing support for CDATA section).
- Added clip regions that can be defined by paths into the painter.
- Added opacity to the painter. Opacity is like constant alpha mask.
- Added PAINTER_INIT_CLEAR flag so painter will know that it should clear the surface.

2010-04-07
- FogBench now contains benchmark summary.

2010-04-06
- Possibility to use main task (main thread) in multithreaded paint engine, but currently
  it's much slower than previous way and disabled.
- Changed some internals in multithreading.

2010-04-05
- New raster painter architecture that performs better in both modes - singlethreaded
  and multithreaded. See diff, there was really a lot of work.
- Painter now supports meta matrix (addition to meta region) that is base matrix for
  all transformations and can't be reset by resetMatrix() or setMatrix() methods.
- Some work on clipping, but not finished yet.
- Additional performance optimizations (raster paint engine).
- Added RasterPaintEngine::_serializeRegion() method to improve performance of serializing
  large regions.
- Added noPaint mask to raster paint engine efficiently returning early if painting can't
  be performed (invalid clip region, OPERATOR_DST, degenerated transformation matrix, etc...).

2010-04-03
- Renamed Class::sharedNull to Class::_dnull. Now all 'd' statics will start at '_d'.
- Removed Region::operation(), added Region::combine() for all ops.
- Region now supports infinite regions, use Region::infinite() to get it.
- All operations with INFINITE regions are supported in Region API.
- Cleaned up mess with META and USER variables (region + origin) in PaintEngine and Painter,
  now there are strict rules (META variables are for whole painting and user variables can
  be temporary and setting / resetting them will not destroy or damage current clipping area).
- Instead of USER variables just use clip().
- Painter::clear() renamed to Painter::fillAll().

2010-04-02
- Added more ROI (rectange of interest) methods in Image and Painter.
- Added Painter::switchTo() so now it's efficient to switch singlethreaded or 
  multithreaded painting to different image or buffer.

2010-04-01
- Removed RegionPoly.cpp / RegionRound.cpp, now it's only used Region::path().
- Fixed few bugs related to Image::glyphFromRegion.
- Some work on fonts (still incomplete).

2010-03-31
- Bunch or refactorization (IntRect, IntPoint, FloatRect, FloatPoint, ...)
- Fonts reworked again, adding more to the font face, removing FontData and
  keeping only FontFace, need a lot of more work to be usable.

- Added 32-bit C code for image compositing (Now Fog library can be
  used by any 32/64-bit architecture).
- Added OPERATOR_MULTIPLY
- Rewritten paths and path storage. Path is now stored as array of commands
  and array of vertices, this allows to simplify path transformation methods,
  rasterizer, and it's also better for memory usage (because command is now 
  only uint8_t).
- Path::add... methods now supports direction argument that can be used to
  set the direction of object being added.

  code that could set raster to invalid memory location is gone, instead there is now
  quite evil matrix manipulation to make meta and user origin fast.

  these methods are used mainly by RasterPaintEngine.
