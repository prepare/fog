//! @brief Condition variable.
//!
//! ThreadCondition wraps pthreads condition variable synchronization or, on
//! Windows, simulates it.  This functionality is very helpful for having
//! several threads wait for an event, as is common with a thread pool managed
//! by a master.  The meaning of such an event in the (worker) thread pool
//! scenario is that additional tasks are now available for processing.  It is
//! used in Chrome in the DNS prefetching system to notify worker threads that
//! a queue now has items (tasks) which need to be tended to.  A related use
//! would have a pool manager waiting on a ThreadCondition, waiting for a
//! thread in the pool to announce (signal) that there is now more room in a
//! (bounded size) communications queue for the manager to deposit tasks, or,
//! as a second example, that the queue of tasks is completely empty and all
//! workers are waiting.
//!
//! USAGE NOTE 1: spurious signal events are possible with this and
//! most implementations of condition variables.  As a result, be
//! *sure* to retest your condition before proceeding.  The following
//! is a good example of doing this correctly:
//!
//! while (!work_to_be_done()) wait(...);
//!
//! In contrast do NOT do the following:
//!
//! if (!work_to_be_done()) wait(...);  //! Don't do this.
//!
//! Especially avoid the above if you are relying on some other thread only
//! issuing a signal up *if* there is work-to-do.  There can/will
//! be spurious signals.  Recheck state on waiting thread before
//! assuming the signal was intentional. Caveat caller ;-).
//!
//! USAGE NOTE 2: Broadcast() frees up all waiting threads at once,
//! which leads to contention for the locks they all held when they
//! called wait(). This results in POOR performance. A much better
//! approach to getting a lot of threads out of wait() is to have each
//! thread (upon exiting wait()) call signal() to free up another
//! wait'ing thread.  Look at condition_variable_unittest.cc in Chrome)
//! for both examples.
//!
//! Broadcast() can be used nicely during teardown, as it gets the job
//! done, and leaves no sleeping threads... and performance is less
//! critical at that point.
//!
//! The semantics of Broadcast() are carefully crafted so that *all*
//! threads that were waiting when the request was made will indeed
//! get signaled.  Some implementations mess up, and don't signal them
//! all, while others allow the wait to be effectively turned off (for
//! a while while waiting threads come around).  This implementation
//! appears correct, as it will not "lose" any signals, and will guarantee
//! that all threads get signaled by Broadcast().
//!
//! This implementation offers support for "performance" in its selection of
//! which thread to revive.  Performance, in direct contrast with "fairness,"
//! assures that the thread that most recently began to wait() is selected by
//! signal to revive. Fairness would (if publicly supported) assure that the
//! thread that has wait()ed the longest is selected. The default policy
//! may improve performance, as the selected thread may have a greater chance of
//! having some of its stack data in various CPU caches.
//!
//! For a discussion of the many very subtle implementation details, see the FAQ
//! at ThreadCondition.cpp.
